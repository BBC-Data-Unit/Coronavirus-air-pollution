In April 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52202974) on significant drops in air pollution in the two weeks since the country went into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations since 17 March were compared to the same period last year, accounting for weekdays.
