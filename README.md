In April 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52202974) on significant drops in air pollution in the two weeks since the country went into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations since the lockdown was announced on 23 March were compared to the same period last year, accounting for weekdays.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
